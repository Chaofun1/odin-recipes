    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>Miso soup is a staple in Japanese cuisine and the Soup for the Soul. We enjoy it almost every single day, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. As a home cook, I would also say that miso soup is probably one of the easiest soups you can make at home. </p>

            <li>Boil 4 cups of water and add in 3 tbsp of dashi powder.</li>

            <li>Add the miso (typically, use 1 tbsp miso for every 1 cup (240 ml) of dashi). Put the miso in a ladle, slowly add the dashi into the ladle, and stir with chopsticks to dissolve the miso completely. Here, I'm using a miso muddler. If you accidentally add too much miso, dilute the miso soup with dashi (or water).</li>

            <li>Here, I'm using a fine-mesh miso strainer, which helps you dissolve the miso faster. After dissolving the miso in the strainer, you may see rice koji (especially when it's koji miso). It's up to you if you want to include it in the miso soup or discard it (personal preference).</li>

            <li>Cut the tofu into Â½-inch (1.3 cm) cubes and add to the miso soup. Tip: Add the tofu after the miso is completely dissolved; otherwise, you might break the tofu when stirring in the miso. Note: It is very common to cut tofu on your palm in Japan. However, it's not required and I recommend using a cutting board if you have never done this.</li>

            <li>Add the dried wakame seaweed. Reheat the miso soup until it is just hot. NEVER BOIL miso soup because it loses nutrients, flavor, and aroma. Add the chopped green onions right before serving to keep their fresh fragrance and color. Tip: If you worry about salt intake, I recommend rehydrating the dried wakame in a separate bowl of water to get rid of the saltiness, instead of rehydrating it in the soup itself.</li>
