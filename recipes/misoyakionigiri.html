            <li>In a small bowl, combine 2 Tbsp miso, 1 tsp sugar, and 1 Tbsp mirin and mix well. Depending on the type of miso, it might be saltier or sweeter than mine. Adjust the flavor by removing/adding sugar. Set the sauce aside for brushing the rice balls later.</li>

            <li>For serving the rice ball, keep 6 shiso leaves aside (they will be placed under the rice ball later). Roll up the rest of shiso leaves and cut into julienned strips.</li>

            <li>Add shiso leaves and roasted white sesame seeds in the bowl of steamed rice. Using a rice scooper, fluff up the rice while you mix in shiso leaves and sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Prepare a small bowl of water and a plate of kosher salt, roughly 2 to 3 tsp. Wet your palms with water, dip your fingers into the salt and rub some of the salt lightly onto your palms. Then using a rice scooper, scoop 1/6 portion of the steamed rice (you should be able to make 6 rice balls).</li>
            <li>Gently form the rice into a ball shape, and then flatten top and bottom. It should look like a thick disk shape.</li>

            <li>Cut the parchment paper to fit the bottom of your frying pan and place it on the pan. Brush the oil on the parchment paper. Place the rice balls and start cooking on medium heat. Make sure to keep some distance between rice balls so they don’t stick to each other.</li>

            <li>Cook the bottom of the rice for about 2.5 minutes. When it’s nicely brown, brush the oil on the top of the rice balls and flip to cook the other side for 2.5 minutes or until nicely brown.</li>

            <li>When both sides are nicely brown, reduce the heat to low heat. Brush/spoon the sauce on top of the rice balls. And flip to cook the miso side for just 10-15 seconds. Then flip to brush the sauce on the other side and cook for 10-15 seconds. </li>

            <li><b>MISO BURNS QUICKLY.</b> Adjust the heat so miso won’t burn but still has a nice char. You can also use an oven, oven toaster, or broiler but make sure to keep an eye on it.</li>
